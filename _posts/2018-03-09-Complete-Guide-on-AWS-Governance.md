### Who is this article for?
This article is for you if:
- You or your company heavily consume AWS (Amazon Web Services)
- You are completely new into the world of AWS but want to start with a clear approach to governance
- You are already somehow managing your AWS accounts but are not completely happy with it
- You don't want to pay third-party companies a huge amount of money to create a governance framework for you and you want to neatly do it all by yourself
- You don't want to use third-party expensive cloud orchestration tools and instead prefer to leverage the existing tools within AWS to manage the cloud

In short, if you are stuck with a very messy environment on your AWS accounts and are desparately wasting so much money in the cloud, this guide is for you. This article will help you to get an idea about how to structure or re-structure your AWS accounts and how to manage the whole environment to reduce your cost.

This guide not only tries to cover the pain points above, but also helps you to achieve better security and auditing in your AWS cloud. I have tried to not only touch the theories but also provide a lot of technical step by step instructions.
